                    Table IV lists the mapping between the 20 biggest package
                    manager and programming languages, and the number of
                    projects we included in our dataset. The Libraries.io dump
                    created in January, 2020 consists of 4,609,663 project entries.
                    However, the CSV file has many bad lines with extra commas
                    making it hard to parse. After removing all the bad lines, we
                    have 3,821,271 valid project entries. Among these, 3,642,738
                    of them provided a GITHUB URL. However, many libraries’
                    pointers to GITHUB repositories are messy or even invalid,
                    making it an impossible task to extract all GITHUB repositories’
                    URLs. With our best effort, we parsed out 3,634,772 valid
                    GITHUB URLs. We noticed that many URLs appeared more
                    than once, or two URLs may point to the same project if there
                    was a change of ownership. After eliminating the duplicates, we
                    found that only 2,103,797 projects are unique. GHTORRENT
                    contains the commit history of 1,550,273 of these projects,
                    which covers 73.70% of the projects on Libraries.io.
